# Use PipEnv to Manage Python packages

Pipenv allows users to install packages and automatically manage those packages dependencies on your behalf.

Python packages are written to a file, so other users of your library can install the utility with the appropriate packages

So removing the requirement to save package requirements with the following command in package management to create save your package list.

```bash
pip freeze -r requirements.txt
```

Virtual environments allow you to ensure your code is reusable with custom requirements installations, as opposed to installing packages which may have conflicts on you default python installations.

To install on Windows or Linux

## Linux

_Ubuntu 18.04 with python 3.6.9. Maybe need to use pip3 in these commands_

Pipx installs applications into an isolated and clean environment on their own. Make it accessible across the entire system

```bash
sudo -H pip install -U pipx
```

And install pipenv

```bash
sudo -H pip install -U pipenv
```

**Usage**  
Install a package we'll use requests

```bash
pipenv install requests
```

Pipenv will create the virtual environment if does not exist and install the package.

```bash

```

Meanwhile it creates a _Pipfile_ and _Pipenv.lock_

Creates a [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file. dev-packages are development only packages such as [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) for example. This is also where you can dictate the specific version of python you want to utilize.

```
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
requests = "*"

[dev-packages]

[requires]
python_version = "3.6"
```

**Pipfile.lock**

**Declare a specific version of python when creating an environment**

```bash
pipenv install --python 2.7
```

**Activate your environment**

```bash
pipenv shell
```

If you receive the following message your environment is already activated. Terminal is not indicating. Close out of terminal, navigate to your directory to activate.

**Run a command from within your enviroment**

```bash
pipenv run
```

**Uninstall a package**

```bash
pipenv uninstall
```

**Whipe your environment**

```bash
pipenv uninstall --all
```

**Find where your environment is located**

```bash
pipenv --venv
```

**You already have a requirements.txt, run this and pipenv will detect and auto create the environment**

```bash
pipenv install
```

**Check for security vulnerablties in your code**

```bash
pipenv check
```

**Update all**

```bash
pipenv update --outdated
```

## Windows

Windows is a first class citizen of pipenv, so you don't have to have Linux to utilize. You can port these commands directly do windows. I just used pip to install pipenv

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

Then all of the above commands in the linux section are available!

**Please enjoy**
